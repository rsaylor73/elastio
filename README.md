`ansible-galaxy collection build`

Ansible will build the tarball based on the namespace and collection name. Ansible will also add the version to the build.

### Installing From The Tar File

`ansible-galaxy collection install elastio-bac-x.x.x.tar.gz`

Replace **x.x.x** with the version that you wish to install.
